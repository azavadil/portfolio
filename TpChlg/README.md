Solution submitted to the TrialPay engineering challenge. 

The challenge was to write a program to determine whether a snake cube puzzle has a solution. The specification can be found on the [TrialPay website](http://blog.trialpay.com/2010/08/trialpay-engineering-challenge-the-snake-cube-puzzle/).

The implemenation uses a BFS algorithm to determine whether a valid solution to the puzzle exists.
