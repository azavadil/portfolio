Solution to the [Boogle assigment](http://see.stanford.edu/materials/icspacs106b/H22-Assign4Boggle.pdf) from CS106B. The main code is in the file [boggle.cpp](https://github.com/azavadil/portfolio/blob/master/CS106B_PA/PA4/boggle.cpp)

The solution relies on recursive backtracking for answer validation and the computer AI. checkWord and its recursive helper function recurWord validate whether words entered by the human player are real words. findWords and its recursive helper function findWord are the AI for the computer player and find all valid words on the board.
